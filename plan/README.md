# OpenSSF Mobilization Plan Stream 1 - Education SIG

## The Problem:
Historically, little attention is paid in traditional software engineering coursework that high-lights and teaches the importance of good cyber security hygiene and secure coding tech-niques. Complicating the lack of trained developers is the ever-growing shortage of trained cyber security professionals that can assist developers as they create, test, and release their code. 

The OpenSSF proposes the following multi-pronged approach to addressing this issue: collect and curate content; expand training; and reward and incentivize developers.


## The Proposed Plan
- [1.0 Collect & Curate Content](https://github.com/ossf/education/blob/main/plan/1.0%20Collect%20and%20Curate%20Content.md)
- [2.0 Expand Training](https://github.com/ossf/education/blob/main/plan/2.0%20Expand%20Training.md)
- [3.0 Reward and Incentivize Developers and Maintainers](https://github.com/ossf/education/blob/main/plan/3.0%20Reward%20and%20Incentivize%20Developers%20and%20Maintainers.md)
