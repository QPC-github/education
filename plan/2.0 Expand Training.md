In the Security Knowledge Framework (SKF), we define a 'Lab' as an isolated web application environment demonstrating a specific Security vulnerability / concept. Each 'Lab' also details how to exploit and fix the said vulnerability / concept in an accompanying 'Write-up' markdown file. Each 'Write-up' should be authored in accordance to the SKF 'Lab/Write-up Style Guide'.
