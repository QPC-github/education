With existing education materials collected, curated, and gap-analyzed in [Section 1](https://github.com/ossf/education/blob/main/plan/1.0%20Collect%20and%20Curate%20Content.md), the next steps are to begin augmenting existing resources and create new training materials using a "Three Legged Stool" approach.  The three legs of the education stool represent different styles of material delivery to learners.  The first type are traditional instructor-led or Comptuer Based Training (CBT) style classes/courses.  The second learning strategy is hands-on labs and hackathon-style events, where we will use is tactile, and appeals to learners that need to actually performa activities to reeinforce learning.  The Last leg of our education stool is what we've termed "Supplemental" or "real-time" learning activities such as documentation, blogs, podcasts, and the like.  These allow maximim flexibility for the learner to ingest and make connectsion with at their own pace.

Imperitive to this effort is partnering with a skilled development team to create these hands-on labs and to perform the required integeations with external systems for badging, certications, and testing.  Details about this team (who will be supporting the Security Knowledge Framework (SKF) applciation and infrastructure) are listed within the [SKF-OPS Appendix](https://github.com/ossf/education/blob/plan/skf-ops-appendix.md).




## 2.1 Goal: SKF Ops Team

The primary objective of the Security Knowledge Framework (SKF) Operations Team is to ensure that SKF survives the test of time and is freely available for generations of Security learning.

## 2.3 Expand current 'Lab' offerings that correlate to the currently indexed Security Knowledge Graph (SKG) 'Standards'

Expand current 'Labs' offerings to complete SKF's coverage with the currently indexed standards (e.g., ASVS & WSTG) in the Security Knowledge Graph (SKG)

In the Security Knowledge Framework (SKF), we define a 'Lab' as an isolated web application environment demonstrating a specific Security vulnerability/concept. Each 'Lab' also details how to exploit and fix the said vulnerability/concept in an accompanying 'Write-up' markdown file. Each 'Write-up' should be authored in accordance with the SKF 'Lab/Write-up Style Guide'.
