### Explanation: Expand current 'Labs' offerings to complete SKF's coverage with the currently indexed standards (e.g., ASVS & WSTG) in the Security Knowledge Graph (SKG)

In the Security Knowledge Framework (SKF), we define a 'Lab' as an isolated web application environment demonstrating a specific Security vulnerability/concept. Each 'Lab' also details how to exploit and fix the said vulnerability/concept in an accompanying 'Write-up' markdown file. Each 'Write-up' should be authored in accordance with the SKF 'Lab/Write-up Style Guide'.
