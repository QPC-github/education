## 2.1 Goal: Expand/improve existing content and training materials
###  Explanation:  Expand/improve existing content and training materials as documented in a survey of existing materials (including train-the-trainers) 
### Key Steps/Milestones 
- Expand education materials to cover 5 critical languages and ecosystems in more depth including lab materials (e.g., C/C++, JavaScript/Node/Typescript, Python, Java, Rust, Go, C#/.NET Core.) (1 person x 5 x $300K): $1,500K [For each this includes computer-based training (CBT), document to read, and slides to present for interactive class. Note: Videos are expensive to update & collaboratively create, we might not want to start there.]

Focus on developer stacks: JavaScript/Node/Typescript, Go/Rust/K8 (Job Descriptions after confirm where external educational resources are strong) 
Goal: Localize the most critical educational materials
 - The identification of what training should be localized should remain with Section 1, but the execution of that localization
