- Section Lead - Sal Kimmich
- Section Team - Emily Fox, VMB, Randall T. Vasquez, Christine Abernathy, CRob
- Section Meeting Time/Details - Fridays 12pm EST via [Zoom](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://zoom.us/j/97388899654?pwd%3Dc2JMUmlsN3A5akh0WEZxaXYxQVE5QT09)

## 3.1 Goal:  Major hubs reflect training and certifications
### Explanation:   Work with the major “hubs” for OSS development (e.g., GitHub and GitLab) and major foundations (e.g. Apache, Eclipse, etc)  to reflect the certifications and accomplishments of contributors and maintainers to the open source projects they house, and in doing so encourage major OSS projects to have their maintainers complete these courses.
### Key Steps/Milestones
Y1: 
- **M1**: List currently available individual contributor badges and recognition from noted sources that include cybersecurity training as a focus. - **M2**: Work with Curation Team to identify training pathways that align.
- **M3**: Contact Github and Gitlab to establish which certifications are already available for this goal(bug bounties that coordinate with OSSF, etc) (David, Xavier, Sal, CROB) 


### Time & resource estimate 
Y2: Rendering of badges reflects key skillsets in cybersecurity, working with integration partners. Identifying the matrix of skills (can be reused as part of curate content). 

Action Item:
Coordinate with Section 1 to confirm existing certification pathways within these stacks (Sal)

Proposed Cybersecurity Matrix Focus:
High Priority Training
- Secure Supply Chain
- Cloud Security
- Data Security
- Application Security

Mid-priority Training
- Network Security
- Endpoint and Mobile Security 

Corporate Oriented Training
- Identity and Access Management
- Advanced Detection and Response
- Cyberincident Response 

## 3.2 Goal:   Offer financial incentives (means-tested), including microgrants, to core maintainers of the most critical OSS to achieve certification. 
### Explanation:  
### Key Steps/Milestones 
- **M1**: Means-tested scholarships for taking and passing courses, $300k plus $50k in administrative overhead: $250k
We propose an average of $1000 in incentives and a reach of 200 developers per year.

### Time & resource estimate 
- Aim 1: Identify existing incentives within and outside of LF. 
- Aim 2: Identify gaps in incentive scheme and propose recommendations for funding for secure supply chain best practices. 
- Aim 3: Define conditions and criteria for eligibility of any new grants.

## 3.3 Goal:   Work with Jobs Boards sites to reflect training and certifications
### Explanation:  Work with major job boards and recruiting sites (e.g., Indeed and LinkedIn) to ensure that these certifications can be presented and verified when viewing a candidate’s profile/personal website 
### Key Steps/Milestones 
- **M1**: Identify key security skill sets that must be rendered
- **M2**:  Identify verification sources from integrations

### Time & resource estimate 

## 3.4 Goal:  Expand existing certifications and badging systems
### Explanation:  Expand existing certification and badge systems so that completion of training/education of people in these areas will be displayed in source code repositories (e.g., GitHub and GitLab), OpenSSF Tooling (Best Practices Badges, Scorecard), and job search systems like LinkedIn & Indeed to expand digital and physical badges/ recognition rewards
### Key Steps/Milestones 
- **M1**: Create a tiered badging program with escalating rewards
- **M2**: Integrate the new badges/certs into other existing LF/OpenSSF badging projects
- **M3**: Rewarding community recognized contributions to open source projects

### Time & resource estimate 
 $200k
 
## 3.5 Goal:  Highlight badged/certified developers to organizations to encourage organizations to hire qualified developers 
### Explanation:  
### Key Steps/Milestones 
-  Y2: 
-  **M1**: Information campaign around verified security skillsets/training
-  **M2**: mprove discoverability of verified security skillsets for recruitors or hiring organizations in a way that is easy to search 

### Time & resource estimate 

## 3.6 Goal:  Incentivize maintainers/contributors to take courses
### Explanation:  
### Key Steps/Milestones 
Maintainers:
- **M1**: Encourage devs to identify successors and provide a contributon ladder with education/certifications part of successor growth
- **M2**: Scholarships/grants/grants for developers: “Connect the dots” for projects from developers to sos.dev to reward developers, ensure there is a clear and guaranteed compensation model
- **M3**: Identify selected maintainers of top OSS projects, pay them to take courses / have certifications! (upskilling)
- **M4**: Add requirement for some OSS projects / employers / proprietary projects: “all maintainers must take a course in developing secure software, here are some examples”
- **M5** Award/Highlight “Most secure oss project” award;
- **M6**: Contributors:
  - [ ] Scholarships/grants/grants for developers / potential new contributors
  - [ ] Align motivations for cybersecurity training: “Why is this important to me”? One-pager (students, companies, etc)
- **M7**: Community:
  - [ ] Support/mentor devs as they take training/certifications (AMA webinar, office hours, full-on mentoring, etc) - mentoring/networking mentor badge
  - [ ] Tickets to conferences/training in a centralized information radiator (in coordination with the curated content)
  - [ ] Security Swag 

### Time & resource estimate 

## 3.7 Goal:  All programs, outreach, and engagement efforts will include success criteria that show effectiveness of the program beyond completion rates prior to their implementation.
### Explanation:  
### Key Steps/Milestones 
- Number of people taking courses /  completions (certifications)
- Maintainer-related - Scorecard (80%+)
- Criteria related to all areas (university, trade school, pre-university, etc.) focused on the first 1-2 year plans
- Track the success rate of rendering security skillsets to hiring engagement - post completion hiring assessment 

### Time & resource estimate 

## 3.8 Goal:  [YEAR 2] Certification/Education Statistical Report 
### Explanation:  Implement an annual report for certification/education success and identify factors that statistically improve project success. 
### Key Steps/Milestones 
- [YEAR 2] 
- **M1**: Add a badge /certificate for maintainers who have security training, partner with other organizations (e.g. GitHub, GitLab, Indeed, & LinkedIn, as noted in year one’s 4.6) to make that information easily available.
- **M2**:  Define a series of metrics to enable:
  - [ ] improving certification and training for maintainers and contributors.
  - [ ] determining if they are improving resulting software & supply chains
  - [ ] determining if they are helping developers (e.g., increased employability/salary), e.g., via a survey.
- **M2.1**: Do this by:
  - [ ] Engage organizations to determine if they see value in the certifications
  - [ ] Survey participants to ascertain their perceived and actual value in achieving and applying those certifications and likelihood to achieve more.
  - [ ] Ascertain if a positive change based on maintainers completing certifications is captured in the ecosystems’ tooling and other visibility tooling


### Time & resource estimate 
 $100K
 
## 3.9 Goal:  [YEAR 2] Expand Certification Badges and Rewards Programs:
### Explanation:  
### Key Steps/Milestones 
- **M1**: Build on gap identification and success signals to be promoted with rewards programs
- **M2**: Identify new areas of education that we are not aware of today 
### Time & resource estimate

## 3.10 Goal: [YEAR 2] Expand scholarships, fellowships, grants, internships, or other methods for developers to learn to develop & distribute secure software: 
### Explanation:  
### Key Steps/Milestones 
- **M1**: Identify existing scholarship of note The Shubhra Kar Linux Foundation Training (LiFT) Scholarship Program https://www.linuxfoundation.org/diversity-inclusivity/lift-scholarships/
- **M2**: Expand rewards into gaps of training 

### Time & resource estimate 
#### $250k  YEAR2

## 3.11 Goal:   Create a unified approach to delivering certification and badging no matter where such training has been delivered, building upon the existing Linux Foundation certification infrastructure
