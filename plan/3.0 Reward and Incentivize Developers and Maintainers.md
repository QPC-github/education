# 3.0 - REWARD AND INCENTIVIZE DEVELOPERS AND MAINTAINERS 

- Section Lead - Sal Kimmich
- Section Team - Emily Fox, VMB, Randall T. Vasquez, Christine Abernathy, CRob
- Section Meeting Time/Details - 

## 3.1 Goal:   Work with the major “hubs” for OSS development (e.g., GitHub and GitLab) and major foundations (e.g. Apache, Eclipse, etc)  to reflect the certifications and accomplishments of contributors and maintainers to the open source projects they house, and in doing so encourage major OSS projects to have their maintainers complete these courses.
### Explanation:  
### Key Steps/Milestones 
### Time & resource estimate 

## 3.2 Goal:   Offer financial incentives (means-tested), including microgrants, to core maintainers of the most critical OSS to achieve certification. We propose an average of $1000 in incentives and a reach of 200 developers per year.
### Explanation:  
### Key Steps/Milestones 
- Means-tested scholarships for taking and passing courses, $300k plus $50k in administrative overhead: $250k

### Time & resource estimate 

## 3.3 Goal:   Work with major job boards and recruiting sites (e.g., Indeed and LinkedIn) to ensure that these certifications can be presented when viewing a candidate’s resume, and trusted to be accurate and up to date
### Explanation:  
### Key Steps/Milestones 
### Time & resource estimate 

## 3.4 Goal:  Expand existing certification and badge systems so that completion of training/education of people in these areas will be displayed in source code repositories (e.g., GitHub and GitLab), OpenSSF Tooling (Best Practices Badges, Scorecard), and job search systems like LinkedIn & Indeed to expand digital and physical badges/ recognition rewards: $200k
### Explanation:  
### Key Steps/Milestones 
- Create a tiered badging program with escalating rewards
- Integrate the new badges/certs into other existing LF/OpenSSF badging projects

### Time & resource estimate 

## 3.5 Goal:  Highlight badged/certified developers to organizations hiring developers
### Explanation:  
### Key Steps/Milestones 
-  K-12. How do we reward people who come out of high school with certifications; Something that helps them in college admissions

### Time & resource estimate 

## 3.6 Goal:  Incentivize maintainers/developers to take courses
### Explanation:  
### Key Steps/Milestones 
- Identify selected maintainers of top OSS projects, pay them to take courses / have certifications! (upskilling)
- Scholarships/grants/grants for developers / potential new developers
- Add requirement for some OSS projects / employers / proprietary projects: “all maintainers must take a course in developing secure software, here are some examples”
- “Why is this important to me”? One-pager (students, companies, etc)
- Award/Highlight “Most secure oss project” award;
- “Connect the dots” for projects from developers to sos.dev to reward developers, ensure there is a clear and guaranteed compensation model
- Support /mentor devs as they take training/certifications (AMA webinar, office hours, full-on mentoring, etc) - mentoring/networking mentor badge
- Encourage devs to identify successors (we’re all mortal) & make education/certifications part of successor growth
- Tickets to conferences/training

### Time & resource estimate 

## 3.7 Goal:  All programs, outreach, and engagement efforts will include success criteria that show effectiveness of the program beyond completion rates prior to their implementation.
### Explanation:  
### Key Steps/Milestones 
- Number of people taking courses /  completions (certifications)
- Maintainer-related - Scorecard (80%+)
- Criteria related to all areas (university, trade school, pre-university, etc.) focused on the first 1-2 year plans

### Time & resource estimate 

## 3.8 Goal:  [YEAR 2] Implement a system to track over time the number of people who earn various certifications and the number OSS projects who have a maintainer who has earned a certification. $100K
### Explanation:  
### Key Steps/Milestones 
- [YEAR 2] Add a badge /certificate for maintainers who have security training, partner with other organizations (e.g. GitHub, GitLab, Indeed, & LinkedIn, as noted in year one’s 4.6) to make that information easily available.
- [YEAR 2] Define a series of metrics to enable:
-- improving certification and training for maintainers and contributors.
-- determining if they are improving resulting software & supply chains
-- determining if they are helping developers (e.g., increased employability/salary), e.g., via a survey.
Do this by:
-- Engage organizations to determine if they see value in the certifications
-- Survey participants to ascertain their perceived and actual value in achieving and applying those certifications and likelihood to achieve more.
-- Ascertain if a positive change based on maintainers completing certifications is captured in the ecosystems’ tooling and other visibility tooling


### Time & resource estimate 

## 3.9 Goal:  Expand Certification Badges and Rewards Programs:
### Explanation:  
### Key Steps/Milestones 
### Time & resource estimate $500K YEAR2

## 3.10 Goal: [YEAR 2] Expand scholarships, fellowships, grants, internships, or other methods for developers to learn to develop & distribute secure software: $250k
### Explanation:  
### Key Steps/Milestones 
- Existing Scholarship of note The Shubhra Kar Linux Foundation Training (LiFT) Scholarship Program https://www.linuxfoundation.org/diversity-inclusivity/lift-scholarships/

### Time & resource estimate 
#### $250k  YEAR2
