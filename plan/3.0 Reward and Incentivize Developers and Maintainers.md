## 3.1 Goal: Major hubs reflect training and certifications
### Explanation: Work with the major “hubs” for OSS development (e.g., GitHub and GitLab) and major foundations (e.g. Apache, Eclipse, etc)  to reflect the certifications and accomplishments of contributors and maintainers to the open source projects they house, and in doing so encourage major OSS projects to have their maintainers complete these courses.
### Key Steps/Milestones
Y1: 
- **M1**: List currently available individual contributor badges and recognition from noted sources that include cybersecurity training as a focus.
