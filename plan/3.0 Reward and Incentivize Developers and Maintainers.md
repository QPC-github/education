## 3.6 Goal:  Incentivize maintainers/contributors to take courses
### Explanation:  Open Source cybersecurity enablement must be rapidly accelerated by ensuring maintainers of critical open source projects are sufficiently trained to understand both preventative best practices and with in supply chain security awareness. To close the gap between qualified maintainers and qualified security contributors, we will incentivize two developer types: Maintainers of critical projects, and cybersecurity focused contributors (as defined by the badging processes developed in 3.2). 
  
### Key Steps/Milestones 
Maintainers:
