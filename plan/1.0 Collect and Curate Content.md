## 1.1 Goal: Review existing educational materials for gaps and opportunities
### Explanation: Before training can be expanded, materials should be collected to understand what is available and what gaps exist in current artifacts so that new materials can be created to fill those gaps or desired new areas.   
### Key Steps/Milestones 
(YEAR 1)
- Create a working document to record existing secure development materials
  - Brainstorm working doc [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BHJ1EMtP_3mVqW6e97qRcwwWkP6b3o8R47KJ0gxJuHo/edit#heading=h.jwsf7ry1xgui)
- Define a structure to organize the content that we are collecting
  - Spreadsheet working doc [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14g7jdt-e-AV1aeFFDKpPkyUh3ljPhC2kalaojMurqBU/edit#gid=0)
- Review existing LF/OpenSSF secure development materials
- Review existing OWASP secure development materials
- Review existing industry secure development materials
  - SAFECode
  - (ISC)2
  - …
- Prepare and conduct a survey to find out “what’s missing” / “what's wrong” from the existing secure development materials (_Dependent upon the list of existing materials_)
  - Determine the criteria and audience for the survey
  - Determine the questions to be included in the survey
  - Determine potential respondants and ways to solicit responses, focus on reaching a diverse audience and reducing bias 
- Perform gap analysis against existing OSSF materials & classes; document areas new content is desired/required
  - Determine the format of the deliverable
### Time & resource estimate
#### 164 hours volunteer work YEAR 1
- 4 SIG members will take 2 hours to develop survey
- 4 SIG members will take 2 hours to review survey results
- 10 SIG members will take 10 hours each to collect content
- 10 SIG members will take 4 hours apiece to review & identify gaps
- 2 SIG members will take 4 hours to assemble list of desired new content 


## 1.2 Goal: Create an Open Educational Resource (OER) library of secure development practices
### Explanation: After materials have been collected and reviewed, a location to stage and publish these items to learners will need to be created.  This will require some type of web-accessible portal and back-end storage that can store various types of learning materials (documents, presentations, video webinars, etc.).
### Key Steps/Milestones 
(YEAR 1)
- Hire OER Librarian to manage, coordinate, and maintain content library
- Decide where, perhaps on a Open Educational Resource platform https://www.oercommons.org/ and/or LF Training & Certification platform
### Time & resource estimate 1 FTE + $100k for tooling YEAR 1
 
 
## 1.3 Goal: Determine venues and personas that content will be created for/delivered to 
### Explanation:  
### Key Steps/Milestones 
(YEAR 1)
- Provide training on the above for at least four major open source developer or security conferences during the 1st year, such as FOSDEM, SCALE, and Open Source Summit, KubeCon. Different curricula will be needed to target the developer audiences of security, devops
- Roles/Personas to engage with
  - Higher Ed
  - Trade school/boot camp/professional
  - Job change training (new to the career path)
  - Primary/secondary Pre-career education
  - Managers of software developers
  - Trainers ( Aka Train the trainers )
  - Contributor/Maintainer training (how to do a pr, maintenance)
  - Compliance
### Time & resource estimate 


## 1.4 Goal: Define training areas of focus
### Explanation:  
### Key Steps/Milestones 
(YEAR 1)
- Focus not just on development skills and techniques, but also associated skills modern developers need such as access controls, testing /validation, and how to build, deploy, and maintain software in DevSecOps scenarios, and training for managers of developers or whom oversee open source, as well as Web/Api, Infra and CI/CD, Desktop applications, and Mobile (FORMERLY GOAL 1.3)
### Time & resource estimate 


## 1.5 Goal:  Identify and prioritize training content to be localized
### Explanation:  
### Key Steps/Milestones 
(YEAR 1)
- Localize training to 5 human, non-English languages x $200K/language)
### Time & resource estimate 
#### $1M in YEAR2


## 1.6 Goal: (YEAR 2) Identify the systems (e.g., StackOverflow, CoPilot, etc.) where developers are copying or extracting insecure code snippets.
(Execution moved to Section 2 as Goal 2.11; identification efforts remain with Section 1)
### Explanation:  
### Key Steps/Milestones 
### Time & resource estimate 
#### XXX in YEAR2
