## 1.1 Goal: Review existing educational materials for gaps and opportunities
#### Explanation: Before training can be expanded, materials should be collected to understand what is available and what gaps exist in current artifacts so that new materials can be created to fill those gaps or desired new areas.

   - [ ] Determine the criteria and audience for the survey
   - [ ] Determine the questions to be included in the survey
   - [ ] Determine potential respondants and ways to solicit responses, focus on reaching a diverse audience and reducing bias 
   - [ ] Perform gap analysis against existing OSSF materials & classes; document areas new content is desired/required [Q2 2023]

   - [ ] issue1.1M4
  - **M5**: Hire Education Program Manager
    Hire Program Manager(PgM) to oversee the execution of the EDU.SIG plan, and then facilitate and coordinate the EUD.SIG as it enters operations.  This role will need to be one of the first steps undertaken as the EDU.SIG plan is being implemented to ensure its smooth delivery.  The EDU.SIG PgM will collect and report out on key metrics of the EDU.SIG program, will coordinate onboarding and training of new EDU.SIG volunteers, amongst other duties. 
    - **M5.1**: Create job description + roles & respsoniblities for EDU.SIG PgM
    - **M5.2**: Hire PgM
    - **M5.3**: On-board PgM and get them up to speed to start manging plan implementation
  - [ ] issue1.1M5
   
### Budget Requests 
- EDU Program Manager - 1 FTE ($300k yearly)

#### Time & resource estimate
#### 164 hours volunteer work YEAR 1
- 4 SIG members will take 2 hours to develop survey
- 4 SIG members will take 2 hours to review survey results
- 10 SIG members will take 10 hours each to collect content

## 1.2 Goal: Create an Open Educational Resource (OER) library of secure development education materials
#### Explanation: After materials have been collected and reviewed, a location to stage and publish these items to learners will need to be created.  This will require some type of web-accessible portal and back-end storage that can store various types of learning materials (documents, presentations, video webinars, etc.).
### Dependencies
- Materials Matrix complete   - [ ] issue1.1M2
- Review of existing materials and verification of public availability / usage complete
### Key Steps/Milestones 
(YEAR 1)
- **M1**: Hire OER Librarian to manage, coordinate, and maintain content library [Q2 2023]
  - [ ] issue1.2M1
- **M2**: Decide where these materials will be stored for public access [TBD]
  - [ ] Perhaps on a Open Educational Resource platform (e.g. https://www.oercommons.org/) and/or LF Training & Certification platform
  - [ ] issue1.2M2
- **M3**: Determine the services / tooling needs for hosting and maintaining the library [TBD]
  - [ ] issue1.2M3

### Budget Requests 
- OER Librarian - 1 FTE ($300k yearly)
- Tooling / services / hosting costs for the library, and associated costs ($100k yearly)


#### Time & resource estimate 1 FTE + $100k for tooling YEAR 1

## Miscellaneous Notes:
Recommendations from (Randall, Sal, David, Xavier) 
Crowdsourcing idea: if the person finds a vulnerable / buggy highly voted SO answer, they just have to do a GitHub search of the snippet itself, and if it’s a highly voted answer,  they WILL find occurrences. Then they can write / launch / test their CodeQL query on those occurrences. No need to create a dummy file, etc.

Another possibility, even simpler: just write the CodeQL query for the pattern, and launch it on the 1000 most critical projects (as per the openssf critical projects WG) for this language blindly to check if you find something. Because if you find nothing, even if it’s a highly voted answer, then it means that this pattern fortunately didn’t make it into the most used projects, so :shrug:

Possibility: a browser extension allowing you to declare some code snippet as vulnerable
