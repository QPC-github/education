## 1.2 Goal: Create an Open Educational Resource (OER) library of secure development practices
### Explanation: After materials have been collected and reviewed, a location to stage and publish these items to learners will need to be created.  This will require some type of web-accessible portal and back-end storage that can store various types of learning materials (documents, presentations, video webinars, etc.).
### Key Steps/Milestones 
- Hire OER Librarian to manage, coordinate, and maintain content library
- (YEAR 2) Decide where, perhaps on a Open Educational Resource platform https://www.oercommons.org/ and/or LF Training & Certification platform
### Time & resource estimate 1 FTE + $100k for tooling YEAR 1
 
 
## 1.4 Goal: Define training areas of focus
### Explanation:  
### Key Steps/Milestones 
- Focus not just on development skills and techniques, but also associated skills modern developers need such as access controls, testing /validation, and how to build, deploy, and maintain software in DevSecOps scenarios, and training for managers of developers or whom oversee open source, as well as Web/Api, Infra and CI/CD, Desktop applications, and Mobile (FORMERLY GOAL 1.3)
- Roles/Personas to engage with
