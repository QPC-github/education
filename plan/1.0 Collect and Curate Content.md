### Key Steps/Milestones 
- Review existing LF/OpenSSF secure development materials
- Review existing OWASP secure development materials
- Review existing industry secure development materials
  - SAFECode
  - (ISC)2
  - …
- Survey to find out “what’s missing” / “what's wrong”
- Perform gap analysis against existing OSSF materials & classes; document areas new content is desired/required
### Time & resource estimate
#### 164 hours volunteer work YEAR 1

## 1.2 Goal: Create an Open Educational Resource (OER) library of secure development practices
### Explanation: After materials have been collected and reviewed, a location to stage and publish these items to learners will need to be created.  This will require some type of web-accessible portal and back-end storage that can store various types of learning materials (documents, presentations, video webinars, etc.).
### Key Steps/Milestones 
- Hire OER Librarian to manage, coordinate, and maintain content library
- Decide where, perhaps on a Open Educational Resource platform https://www.oercommons.org/ and/or LF Training & Certification platform
### Time & resource estimate 1 FTE + $100k for tooling YEAR 1
 
## 1.3 Goal:   Focus not just on development skills and techniques, but also associated skills modern developers need such as access controls, testing /validation, and how to build, deploy, and maintain software in DevSecOps scenarios, and training for managers of developers or whom oversee open source, as well as Web/Api, Infra and CI/CD, Desktop applications, and Mobile

## 1.10 Goal: Identify areas where developers are copying or extracting insecure code snippets and work to correct the most widely-applied vulnerable snippets in order to address common problems and challenges, such as those found on StackOverflow.  Provide justification and reasoning on the change to support educating adopters of snippets, and ensure that proposed text is properly licensed as OSS (e.g., MIT, not just CC licenses because they don’t address patents). Build on existing research in this area.
