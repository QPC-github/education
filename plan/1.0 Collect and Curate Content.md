## Introduction
Before any meaningful learning can be developed or shared, an inventory of useful existing resources should be collected.  This allows for the alignment with learning paths and objectives, as well as highlighting gaps and areas that are missing from the current Common Body of Knowledge (CBK).  This information helps [Section 2](https://github.com/ossf/education/blob/main/plan/2.0%20Expand%20Training.md) to develop more complete coursework, labs, and supplementary materials as well as helps with the understanding of what existing materials may need updated to current practices and techniques.[Section 3](https://github.com/ossf/education/blob/main/plan/3.0%20Reward%20and%20Incentivize%20Developers%20and%20Maintainers.md) will provide means to reward and encourage developers ans tudents of all types to adopt and uses these secure development and management techniques.

## 1.1 Goal: Review existing educational materials for gaps and opportunities

## Miscellaneous Notes

Recommendations from (Randall, Sal, David, Xavier)
Crowdsourcing idea: if the person finds a vulnerable / buggy highly voted SO answer, they just have to do a GitHub search of the snippet itself, and if it’s a highly voted answer, they WILL find occurrences. Then they can write / launch / test their CodeQL query on those occurrences. No need to create a dummy file, etc.

Another possibility, even simpler: just write the CodeQL query for the pattern, and launch it on the 1000 most critical projects (as per the OpenSSF critical projects WG) for this language blindly to check if you find something. Because if you find nothing, even if it’s a highly voted answer, then it means that this pattern, fortunately, didn’t make it into the most used projects, so :shrug:

Possibility: a browser extension allowing you to declare some code snippets as vulnerable
