## Miscellaneous Notes:
Recommendations from (Randall, Sal, David, Xavier) 
Crowdsourcing idea: if the person finds a vulnerable / buggy highly voted SO answer, they just have to do a GitHub search of the snippet itself, and if it’s a highly voted answer,  they WILL find occurrences. Then they can write / launch / test their CodeQL query on those occurrences. No need to create a dummy file, etc.

Another possibility, even simpler: just write the CodeQL query for the pattern, and launch it on the 1000 most critical projects (as per the openssf critical projects WG) for this language blindly to check if you find something. Because if you find nothing, even if it’s a highly voted answer, then it means that this pattern fortunately didn’t make it into the most used projects, so :shrug:

Possibility: a browser extension allowing you to declare some code snippet as vulnerable
