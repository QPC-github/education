## 1.1 Goal: Review existing educational materials for gaps and opportunities
#### Explanation: Before training can be expanded, materials should be collected to understand what is available and what gaps exist in current artifacts so that new materials can be created to fill those gaps or desired new areas.   
### Dependencies
- None
### Key Steps/Milestones 
(YEAR 1)
- Create a working document to record existing secure development materials [Sept 2022]
  - Brainstorm working doc [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BHJ1EMtP_3mVqW6e97qRcwwWkP6b3o8R47KJ0gxJuHo/edit#heading=h.jwsf7ry1xgui)
- Create a Materials Matrix, including defining a structure to organize the content that we are collecting [Oct 2022]
  - Spreadsheet working doc [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14g7jdt-e-AV1aeFFDKpPkyUh3ljPhC2kalaojMurqBU/edit#gid=0)
- Review existing secure development materials from the following sources: Linux Foundation / OpenSSF, OWASP and other OSSF member organizations [Q4 2022]
  - See if an e-mail blast can be sent to all OSSF member organizations
- Prepare and conduct a survey to find out “what’s missing” / “what's wrong” from the existing secure development materials (_Dependent upon the list of existing materials_) [Q1 2023]
  - Determine the criteria and audience for the survey
  - Determine the questions to be included in the survey
  - Determine potential respondants and ways to solicit responses, focus on reaching a diverse audience and reducing bias 
- Perform gap analysis against existing OSSF materials & classes; document areas new content is desired/required [Q2 2023]
  - Determine the format of the deliverable report
### Budget Requests 
- EDU Program Manager - 1 FTE ($300k yearly)

#### Time & resource estimate
#### 164 hours volunteer work YEAR 1
- 4 SIG members will take 2 hours to develop survey
- 4 SIG members will take 2 hours to review survey results
- 10 SIG members will take 10 hours each to collect content
- 10 SIG members will take 4 hours apiece to review & identify gaps
- 2 SIG members will take 4 hours to assemble list of desired new content

## 1.2 Goal: Create an Open Educational Resource (OER) library of secure development education materials
#### Explanation: After materials have been collected and reviewed, a location to stage and publish these items to learners will need to be created.  This will require some type of web-accessible portal and back-end storage that can store various types of learning materials (documents, presentations, video webinars, etc.).
### Dependencies
- Materials Matrix complete
- Review of existing materials and verification of public availability / usage complete
### Key Steps/Milestones 
(YEAR 1)
- Hire OER Librarian to manage, coordinate, and maintain content library [Q2 2023]
- Decide where these materials will be stored for public access [TBD]
  - Perhaps on a Open Educational Resource platform (e.g. https://www.oercommons.org/) and/or LF Training & Certification platform
- Determine the services / tooling needs for hosting and maintaining the library [TBD]
- 
### Budget Requests 
- OER Librarian - 1 FTE ($300k yearly)
- Tooling / services / hosting costs for the library, and associated costs ($100k yearly)


#### Time & resource estimate 1 FTE + $100k for tooling YEAR 1

## 1.3 Goal: Determine venues and personas that content will be created for/delivered to 
#### Explanation:  
### Dependencies
- Materials matrix complete
### Key Steps/Milestones 
(YEAR 1)
- Determine personas that align with the Materials Matrix [TBD]
  - Higher Ed
  - Trade school/boot camp/professional
  - Job change training (new to the career path)
  - Primary/secondary Pre-career education
  - Managers of software developers
  - Trainers ( Aka Train the trainers )
  - Contributor/Maintainer training (how to do a pr, maintenance)
  - Compliance
- Formally document these personas for use by the EDU SIG and other OSSF workgroups [TBD]
- Provide training on the above for at least four major open source developer or security conferences during 2023 (e.g. FOSDEM, SCALE, and Open Source Summit, KubeCon). Different curricula will be needed to target the developer audiences of security, devops.  [TBD]

## 1.4 Goal: Define training areas of focus
#### Explanation:  
### Dependencies
- 
### Key Steps/Milestones 
(YEAR 1)
- Focus not just on development skills and techniques, but also associated skills modern developers need such as access controls, testing /validation, and how to build, deploy, and maintain software in DevSecOps scenarios, and training for managers of developers or whom oversee open source, as well as Web/Api, Infra and CI/CD, Desktop applications, and Mobile [TBD]
### Budget Requests

## 1.5 Goal:  Identify and prioritize training content to be localized
#### Explanation:  
### Dependencies

### Key Steps/Milestones 
(YEAR 1)
- Localize training to 5 human, non-English languages [TBD]
### Budget Requests 
- Localization Costs ($200k x5 = $1M)
#### Time & resource estimate

## Miscellaneous Notes:
Recommendations from (Randall, Sal, David, Xavier) 
Crowdsourcing idea: if the person finds a vulnerable / buggy highly voted SO answer, they just have to do a GitHub search of the snippet itself, and if it’s a highly voted answer,  they WILL find occurrences. Then they can write / launch / test their CodeQL query on those occurrences. No need to create a dummy file, etc.

Another possibility, even simpler: just write the CodeQL query for the pattern, and launch it on the 1000 most critical projects (as per the openssf critical projects WG) for this language blindly to check if you find something. Because if you find nothing, even if it’s a highly voted answer, then it means that this pattern fortunately didn’t make it into the most used projects, so :shrug:

Possibility: a browser extension allowing you to declare some code snippet as vulnerable
