# **OpenSSF Education Special Interest Group (SIG)**
This Education SIG is a group working within the [OpenSSF's Best Practices Working Group](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers) formed to advance and deliver upon [The OpenSSF's Mobilization Plan - Stream 1](https://8112310.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/8112310/OpenSSF/White%20House%20OSS%20Mobilization%20Plan.pdf?hsCtaTracking=3b79d59d-e8d3-4c69-a67b-6b87b325313c%7C7a1a8b01-65ae-4bac-b97c-071dac09a2d8).  This SIG is dedicated to providing industry standard secure software development training materials that will educate learners of all levels and backgrounds on how to create, compose, deploy, and maintain software securely using best practices in cyber and application security.

## 
**Motivation**

Historically, little attention is paid in traditional software engineering coursework that highlights and teaches the importance of good cyber security hygiene and secure coding techniques. Complicating the lack of trained developers is the ever-growing [shortage](https://www.cyberseek.org/heatmap.html) of trained cyber security professionals that can assist developers as they create, test, and release their code.

## 
**Objective**

Deliver Baseline Secure Software Development Education and Certification to All by:
- Collecting & Curating Content
- Expanding Training
- Rewarding & incentiving Developers
