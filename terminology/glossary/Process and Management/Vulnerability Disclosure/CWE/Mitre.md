# CWE

## Description

Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE™) is a community-developed list of common software and hardware weakness types that have security ramifications. “Weaknesses” are flaws, faults, bugs, or other errors in software or hardware implementation, code, design, or architecture that if left unaddressed could result in systems, networks, or hardware being vulnerable to attack. The CWE List and associated classification taxonomy serve as a language that can be used to identify and describe these weaknesses in terms of CWEs.
