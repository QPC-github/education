# CVE

## Description

CVE stands for Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures. CVE is a free service that identifies and catalogs known software or firmware vulnerabilities. CVE is not, in itself, an actionable vulnerability database. It is, in effect, a standardized dictionary of publicly known vulnerabilities and exposures. CVE is used by many security-related products and services such as vulnerability management and remediation, intrusion detection, incident management, and more.
