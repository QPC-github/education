# MPCVD

## Description

Multi-Party Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure (MPCVD) is the process of remediation of vulnerabilities in modern technology systems which can vary and depend on the nature of the vulnerable component. Certain vulnerability handling efforts can require multiple ecosystem players taking action at multiple and interdependent layers within a given information and communication technology (ICT) system. Mitigation can necessitate the engagement of the broad ecosystem of stakeholders to develop, test and deploy mitigations in a manner geared to incentivize adoption by end users.
