# Bug Bar

## Description

Quality gates and bug bars are used to establish minimum acceptable levels of security and privacy quality. A project team must negotiate quality gates (for example, all compiler warnings must be triaged and fixed prior to code check-in) for each development phase. A bug bar is a quality gate which is used to define the severity thresholds of security vulnerabilities—for example, no known vulnerabilities in the application with a “critical” or “important” rating at time of release. The bug bar, once set, should never be relaxed.
